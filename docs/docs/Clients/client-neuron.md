## Get Started

There are 3 ways to generate a wallet:
- Start from scratch
- Recover wallet 
- Import from keystore file

### 1. Start from scratch

#### Step 1: Create a wallet

#### Step 2: Save wallet seed (mnemonic) phrase

- The wallet seed is the mnemonic phrase of the private key. You can use these words to recover your wallet (address).

- Record and save them these words in a safe place.

#### Step 3: Input wallet seed (mnemonic) phrase

Input wallet seed (mnemonic) phrase from step 2.

#### Step 4: Name your wallet and set password

The password is used for security-related actions, eg:
- backup wallet
- delete wallet

#### Step 5: Address generated 

<img src="../assets/neuron-key-manager/address.png" width = "800"/>

> **This address can be used as the *Receiving Address* for the Nervos token sale on [Coinlist](https://coinlist.co/nervos).**

> **Please keep the seed (mnemonic) phrase and keystore file safe. Do not disclose the details to anyone or you may risk losing all of your tokens.**

> **You can use the seed (mnemonic) phrase or keystore file to manage your tokens after Nervos CKB mainnet launch.**

#### Step 6: Genereate more addresses

The Key Manager application only supports one address at present. To generate more addresses, you should delete current wallet and re-create new wallet.

> Click "wallet" menu and "delete wallet" submenu to delete existing wallet.

> **Double confirm that you have backup your seed (mnemonic) phrase and keystore files before delete the wallet from Key Manager.**

### 2. Recover wallet 

#### Step 1: Click "Import Wallet Seed" tab
